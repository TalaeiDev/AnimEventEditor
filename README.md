3. Select an **Animation Clip** you want to preview.
4. Use the **time slider** to scrub through the animation.
5. Set the **Event Function Name**.
6. (Optional) Assign an **Object Parameter** if needed.

## üì¶ Requirements
- Unity **2022 LTS** or later recommended.
- Full support for **Unity 6** (2024+) versions.
- A **Character GameObject** in the scene (must have an `Animator` component).

---

## üìã Notes
- Make sure your Character is **instantiated in the scene**, not just a prefab from the Project window.
- Works with **generic**, **humanoid**, and **legacy** animations.
- This tool modifies the selected AnimationClip by adding events.

üõ† Future Plans
üîâ Play Sound or VFX During Preview
Automatically trigger and preview footsteps, slash effects, or hit sounds based on animation events.

Support for AudioClip, ParticleSystem, or prefab-based VFX.

Preview effects directly in the Editor as you scrub.

ü™ü Separate Animation Preview Window
Add a dedicated preview window that renders the animated character in a clean, focused UI, separate from the Scene view.

üéöÔ∏è Animation Curve Editing Support
Add and edit custom animation curves (e.g., for blending, float properties, shader effects, or motion parameters).

Integrated curve field for easy editing.

Support for curve-driven event triggers.

ü¶∂ Auto Footstep Detection
Detect foot contact automatically using foot position or root motion and place footstep events for you.

üóÇÔ∏è Event Categories with Color Labels
Visually group events (e.g., Footstep, Slash, Impact) on the timeline using color-coded markers for better readability.

üîÅ Batch Event Editing
Copy/paste events between clips.

Apply events to multiple clips or character rigs.

Export/import to JSON or ScriptableObjects.
