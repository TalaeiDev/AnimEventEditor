# üé¨ AnimEvent Editor

**AnimEvent Editor** is a lightweight, powerful Unity Editor extension that lets you preview animations and insert Animation Events with precision ‚Äî directly from a custom editor window.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. In Unity, open the editor from `TalaeiDev > AnimEvent Editor`.
2. Assign a **Character** (scene object with an `Animator` component).
3. Select an **Animation Clip**.
4. Use the **slider** to scrub through the clip and preview motion.
5. Set a **Function Name** and optional **Object Parameter**.
6. Click **"Add Event at Current Time"** to inject an `AnimationEvent`.

> ‚úÖ Works best with scene-instantiated characters, not prefab assets directly.

- Unity **2022 LTS** or **Unity 6.0+** (2024 LTS) recommended.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features

- üîâ **Play Sound or VFX During Preview**  
  - Preview **slash**, **impact**, or **footstep** effects right in the editor.  
  - Supports `AudioClip`, `ParticleSystem`, or prefab-based triggers.

- ü™ü **Separate Animation Preview Window**  
  - Preview your animation in a **dedicated, minimal UI panel**, independent of the Scene view.

- üéöÔ∏è **Animation Curve Editing**  
  - Add and manage custom animation curves (e.g., for float parameters, shader intensities, etc.).  
  - Curve editor embedded directly in the event tool.

- ü¶∂ **Auto Footstep Detection**  
  - Automatically place footstep events based on foot bone height or ground contact timing.

- üóÇÔ∏è **Event Categories & Color Labels**  
  - Organize events with visual tags (e.g., `Footstep`, `Attack`, `Effect`) in the timeline.

- üîÅ **Batch Event Editing**  
  - Copy/paste events across clips or rigs.  
  - Export/import events as JSON or ScriptableObject.

## üß† Why Use This Tool?

Unity‚Äôs built-in Animation Event editor is functional but limited.  
**AnimEvent Editor** gives you:
- Real-time, scrub-based feedback
- More precise control over timing
- Fast workflows for VFX/audio syncing
- A better foundation for scaling to multi-clip workflows
